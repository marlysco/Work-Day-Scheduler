# Work-Day-Scheduler

Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

The goal of this project was to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code.

Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.

This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery; using Moment.js library to work with date and time.

You can access to this app using the following link:
